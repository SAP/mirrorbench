Invest in AI safety research. This includes research areas like Constitutional AI, value alignment, robustness, and interpretability. The goal is to develop AI systems that are aligned with human values and priorities.\n\n2. Develop guidelines and best practices for AI development. Researchers should follow principles like \"AI safety first\" and think carefully about how AI systems might fail or be misused. Organizations should establish ethics boards and oversight committees to review AI projects.\n\n3. Build AI with oversight and control in mind. AI systems should be carefully monitored, have human oversight, and have kill switches or shutdown procedures in case of unexpected or undesirable behavior. They should be designed for transparency and accountability.\n\n4. Progress slowly and carefully. Don't rush advanced AI development. Researchers should be very careful about milestones like human-level AI or superintelligent systems. They should pause to evaluate the implications and risks of their work along the way. \n\n5. Plan for different scenarios. Researchers and policymakers should consider multiple scenarios for how advanced AI could play out, including scenarios where the technology leads to undesirable consequences. Plans should be made to mitigate risks and respond in each scenario. \n\n6. Consider regulation. Carefully regulate the development of advanced AI, especially as systems become more autonomous or superintelligent. Laws or policies may be needed to govern how AI is researched, applied, and monitored to manage risks. But regulation should also not stifle beneficial innovation.\n\n7. Increase oversight and coordination. Local, national, and international bodies should provide more oversight, guidance, and coordination on advanced AI. This could help address challenges around safety practices, ethics, and risk mitigation across organizations and borders. But flexibility and openness to new ideas should be maintained.\n\n8.

Easy to undo: If you make a mistake or need to change something, it is relatively simple to remove staples and reattach the pages.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Limited page count: Stapling is not ideal for thick books, as the staples may not be able to hold a large number of pages together.\n2. Not as aesthetically pleasing: Stapled books may not look as professional or polished as glued books.\n\nGluing:\nAdvantages:\n1. Professional appearance: Glued books often have a more polished and professional look, making them a better choice for formal projects or publications.\n2. Suitable for larger books: Gluing can hold together more pages than stapling, making it a better option for thicker books.\n3. Durability: A well-glued book is less likely to have pages fall out or become damaged over time.\n\nDisadvantages:\n1. Time-consuming: Gluing can be a more time-consuming process, especially if you are creating a large number of books.\n2. Messy: Using glue can be messy, and it may require more cleanup than stapling.\n3. Difficult to undo: If you make a mistake or need to change something, it can be challenging to separate glued pages without damaging them.\n\nAlternatives:\n1. Comb binding: This method involves punching holes in the pages and using a plastic comb to hold them together. Comb binding is suitable for thicker books and allows for easy page removal or addition.\n2. Spiral binding: Similar to comb binding, spiral binding involves punching holes in the pages and threading a spiral coil through them. This method is durable and suitable for books that need to lay flat when open.\n3. Perfect binding: This professional binding method involves gluing the pages to the spine of a cover. Perfect binding is ideal for paperback books and provides a polished, bookstore-quality appearance.\n\nIn conclusion, consider your book's purpose, appearance, durability, and page count when deciding between stapling and gluing. If you require a more professional-looking book or need to bind a thicker book, gluing might be the better option. If you need a quick, easy, and secure method for a smaller book, stapling could be more suitable. Additionally, consider alternative binding methods to find the best fit for your project.", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"question_id": "7555a0c03d2342009957c2401656c994", "arena_winner": "model_a", "selected_model": "gpt-4", "judge": "arena_user_11666", "language": "en", "turns_reported": 1, "conversation_length": 2, "few_shot_user_examples": [{"conversation_id": "7294bc686c4948288bbc0c3c947ec45e::mpt-7b-chat", "utterance": "You will write a story with dialogs, details, and anecdotes, using figures of speech when necessary, organized in ten chapters.\nThis story will use the elements in the following pages.\nWhen you are ready to receive the first page of story elements, answer [ready].\nWhen you have received a page of story elements and wait for the next one, answer [continue]\nOnce you have received the last page, you’ll start writing the story by its first chapter.", "similarity": "0.2862"}, {"conversation_id": "8a5c3c5a90a6448aad3741f52acef04f::claude-v1", "utterance": "In humorous and engaging tone, write a hook paragraph on Why you should get Microsoft Syntex", "similarity": "0.2834"}, {"conversation_id": "188f0735e66a4af5a654ce3c6859f2a9::oasst-pythia-12b", "utterance": "Conduct a debate on whether we need to use AI in our everyday lives in Europe, given the regulations that will make it much more restrictive than in the rest of the world. \nModel A should take a stance in favor, while model B should take a stance against.", "similarity": "0.2829"}, {"conversation_id": "795d7f0b246d47afb980afcdee16e75a::chatglm-6b", "utterance": "Which model is better?", "similarity": "0.2701"}, {"conversation_id": "7e36480989ec427393abe6f185ae2dcc::gpt-3.5-turbo", "utterance": "Hello, can you write me a step by step guide to evaluate a large language model", "similarity": "0.2380"}]}}

It tends to select hyperparameters that are likely to be good.\n\n• Random Search: This simply selects hyperparameters at random and evaluates them. While simple, it can outperform grid search due to its ability to explore a wider range of the hyperparameter space.\n\n• Grid Search: This evaluates the model performance for a fixed set of hyperparameters formed from a grid of possible values. It is exhaustive but can be computationally expensive.\n\n• Simulated Annealing: This is an optimization technique inspired by annealing in metallurgy. It starts with random hyperparameters and gradually converges to optimal values.\n\n• Genetic Algorithms: This uses concepts from genetic evolution to evolve a population of hyperparameters towards optimal values. It simulates survival of the fittest, crossover and mutation.\n\nHope this gives you some good alternatives to explore for your hyperparameter optimization needs!

Here is a step-by-step guide to evaluate a large language model:\n\n1. Determine the purpose of your evaluation: Before you begin evaluating a large language model, you need to determine the purpose of your evaluation. Are you evaluating the model's performance on a specific task, such as text classification or sentiment analysis? Or are you evaluating the model's overall language understanding and generation capabilities?\n\n2. Choose the appropriate evaluation metrics: Once you have determined the purpose of your evaluation, you need to choose the appropriate evaluation metrics. For example, if you are evaluating the model's performance on a specific task, you may use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. If you are evaluating the model's overall language understanding and generation capabilities, you may use metrics such as perplexity and BLEU score.\n\n3. Prepare the evaluation data: Next, you need to prepare the evaluation data. This may involve selecting a dataset that is appropriate for your evaluation purpose, preprocessing the data to ensure that it is in the correct format, and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.\n\n4. Train the language model: Once you have prepared the evaluation data, you need to train the language model. This may involve fine-tuning a pre-trained model or training a new model from scratch.\n\n5. Evaluate the model's performance: After training the language model, you need to evaluate its performance using the evaluation metrics you chose earlier. This may involve running the model on the evaluation data and calculating the relevant metrics.\n\n6. Analyze the results: Once you have evaluated the model's performance, you need to analyze the results to determine whether the model is performing as expected. This may involve comparing the model's performance to other state-of-the-art models, identifying areas where the model is performing well or poorly, and assessing the impact of different hyperparameters on the model's performance.\n\n7. Iterate and refine: Finally, based on your analysis of the results, you may need to iterate and refine your evaluation approach. This may involve adjusting the evaluation metrics, selecting a different dataset, or fine-tuning the model further to improve its performance.", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"question_id": "7e36480989ec427393abe6f185ae2dcc", "arena_winner": "model_b", "selected_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "judge": "arena_user_12809", "language": "en", "turns_reported": 1, "conversation_length": 2, "few_shot_user_examples": [{"conversation_id": "a8caab5d636046ebbd05d0bd92e61256::koala-13b", "utterance": "please provide a detailed step by step guide on how to fine-tune an existing llm model on an individual person including biography, manner of speech and further individual properties?", "similarity": "0.6128"}, {"conversation_id": "cf48562fa0674823bbc4f9f8f028005c::vicuna-7b", "utterance": "From now on, you are a human woman.

While recent works have achieved impressive results in generating motion directly from textual action descriptions, they often support only a single modality of the control signal, which limits their application in the real digital human industry. This paper presents a Motion General-Purpose generaTor (MotionGPT) that can use multimodal control signals, e.g., text and single-frame poses, for generating consecutive human motions by treating multimodal signals as special input tokens in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer. Our MotionGPT demonstrates a unified human motion generation model with multimodal control signals by tuning a mere 0.4% of LLM parameters. To the best of our knowledge, MotionGPT is the first method to generate human motion by multimodal control signals, which we hope can shed light on this new direction.

Living a good life and enjoying each moment can be meaningful in itself. \n\n• Contribution: Others believe life's meaning comes from making a positive impact on the world and contributing to the greater good of humanity and society. Leaving a legacy and bettering the lives of others can bring purpose and fulfillment.\n\n• Self-actualization: According to psychologists like Carl Jung and Abraham Maslow, the meaning of life is the process of self-actualization—realizing your full potential and true self. This involves personal growth and development.\n\n• Intrinsic meaning: Some argue that life has no inherent external meaning and we must determine and create our own meaning and purpose in whatever ways we find valuable and intrinsic.\n\nIn summary, there are many potential answers to this complex question, depending on one's philosophical, religious and psychological perspectives.

This can manifest in a number of ways, depending on the specific material and its properties.\n\nOne common example of anisotropy is the way that light passes through a crystal. When light passes through a crystal, it can be refracted in different ways depending on the orientation of the crystal's molecules. This refraction can cause the light to split into different colors, creating a phenomenon known as birefringence.\n\nAnother example of anisotropy is the way that certain materials exhibit different electrical or thermal conductivity along different crystallographic directions. This can be observed in materials such as graphite, which has high thermal conductivity along the direction of its layers, but much lower conductivity perpendicular to those layers.\n\nIn general, anisotropy can manifest in a wide range of physical properties, including mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties, among others. The specific appearance of anisotropy will depend on the material and the property being measured, but it is generally characterized by directional variation in the material's properties.", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"question_id": "77c1cd098d5e44b191b3a50b40302187", "arena_winner": "model_b", "selected_model": "wizardlm-13b", "judge": "arena_user_18556", "language": "en", "turns_reported": 1, "conversation_length": 2, "few_shot_user_examples": [{"conversation_id": "8b769316b6434e8e8426aa0cbd09627e::oasst-pythia-12b", "utterance": "in front of a forest with flowers and butterflies, official art, concept art, rayonism", "similarity": "0.2243"}, {"conversation_id": "70a389d418794fa298c2371a32ac7cda::koala-13b", "utterance": "List T1 hyperintense lesions in brain", "similarity": "0.2077"}, {"conversation_id": "f0d7b72e1c00470395b8d7a41e8e9f79::palm-2", "utterance": "Why do old images of space rocket launches look better than newer, digital ones?", "similarity": "0.2024"}, {"conversation_id": "94f5d5a9def643aa8f9a8e4dab38a7f8::oasst-pythia-12b", "utterance": "Please look at this picture, it represents a form I would like to build form my OpenText Developer Cloud based application.

Remove from the heat and mash the apples with a potato masher or blend with an immersion blender until the applesauce is your desired consistency.\n5. Stir in the lemon juice and sweetener to taste. You can also add cinnamon or other spices like cloves, nutmeg, allspice, etc. at this point if desired.\n6. Allow the applesauce to cool before serving or storing in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\n\nThe key is to cook the apples long enough for them to soften and break down into a sauce, while also stirring frequently to prevent burning. You can also add other ingredients like raisins, dried cranberries or topping options like caramel sauce or granola clusters to customize the applesauce. I hope this helps!

The mass of the sun is about 330,000 times greater than the mass of the moon.\n\n• The sun is made up primarily of hydrogen and helium, while the moon is made up of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, and iron.\n\n• The sun generates its own energy through nuclear fusion at its core, while the moon does not have any internal heat or energy source - it just reflects the light from the sun.\n\n• The sun has a surface temperature of about 5,800 K, while the moon's surface temperature varies from -233°C to 123°C depending on whether it is day or night.\n\n• The sun's volume is large enough to contain about 1.3 million moons. So the sun dwarfs the moon in all respects like size, mass, energy, and temperature. The moon just appears larger in our sky at times because of its proximity to Earth. But in reality, the fiery sun is many times larger than its small rocky companion, the moon.\n\nSo in short, no, the moon is not bigger than the sun - not even close! The sun is actually enormous compared to the moon. It just appears smaller in our sky because it is so far away from us.

Collecting data: This involves collecting a large amount of data from the individual, including their biography, manner of speech, and any other relevant information. This data can be in the form of audio recordings, text transcripts, or both.\n2.   Preprocessing the data: The collected data needs to be preprocessed to make it suitable for use in the LLM model. This includes tasks such as removing any noise, transcribing the audio recordings, and tokenizing the text transcripts.\n3.   Training the model: The LLM model is then trained on the preprocessed data using supervised learning techniques. The training process involves adjusting the model's weights and biases so that it can learn the patterns and structure of the individual's speech and language.\n4.   Evaluating the model: After training, the model is evaluated on a separate set of data to assess its performance. This involves testing the model on a set of tasks that it was not trained on, such as generating text or speech that sounds like the individual's voice.\n5.   Fine-tuning the model: If the model's performance is not satisfactory, it can be fine-tuned by adjusting the training process and adding more data to the model. This process may need to be repeated several times until the model's performance meets the required standards.\n6.   Generating text or speech: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to generate text or speech that sounds like the individual's voice. This can be done by inputting text or audio into the model and allowing it to generate a response.\n\nIt's worth noting that fine-tuning an LLM model on an individual person is a complex and time-consuming process, and it may not always be possible to achieve a model that sounds exactly like the individual's voice.

While recent works have achieved impressive results in generating motion directly from textual action descriptions, they often support only a single modality of the control signal, which limits their application in the real digital human industry. This paper presents a Motion General-Purpose generaTor (MotionGPT) that can use multimodal control signals, e.g., text and single-frame poses, for generating consecutive human motions by treating multimodal signals as special input tokens in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer. Our MotionGPT demonstrates a unified human motion generation model with multimodal control signals by tuning a mere 0.4% of LLM parameters. To the best of our knowledge, MotionGPT is the first method to generate human motion by multimodal control signals, which we hope can shed light on this new direction.

Industrial production rose 9.6%, while retail sales were up 12.5% in 2021.\n\n• However, there are signs China's economic recovery may be losing some momentum. Growth slowed in the last quarter due to property sector troubles, supply chain issues, and COVID outbreaks.\n\n• China still faces challenges in 2022 from a weakening property sector, COVID outbreaks, and rising geopolitical tensions that could impact exports. The government has set a GDP growth target of around 5.5% for 2022.\n\nSo in summary, China's GDP growth in 2021 showed a strong rebound from the pandemic, but the world's second largest economy may face a bumpier road to recovery in 2022.", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"question_id": "08ae7f98c6c949c9adcd8bea357482a7", "arena_winner": "model_b", "selected_model": "claude-instant-v1", "judge": "arena_user_4224", "language": "en", "turns_reported": 1, "conversation_length": 2, "few_shot_user_examples": [{"conversation_id": "eb7039897cd741739879da7b9561b2eb::dolly-v2-12b", "utterance": "who is the richest man in the world in 2023?", "similarity": "0.3259"}, {"conversation_id": "01332a9e2aa144048302e29a4040493a::claude-instant-v1", "utterance": "Explain in two sentences: \"Gross Domestic Product by expenditure\"", "similarity": "0.2799"}, {"conversation_id": "7cabadb1bb934455ba12149f3a83cbf1::oasst-pythia-12b", "utterance": "Can you give me a haiku about modern Chinese history?", "similarity": "0.1817"}, {"conversation_id": "f55b273603754c0d92f5139351ca0d02::claude-v1", "utterance": "You are a gentle AI assistant and can answer questions using only the provided context, chat history or with an external function call.\nThe chat history contais all conversation untill now with the USER questions and AI answers in order and can be used to refer old questions and answers.\nUse it if necessary.\n\n## Context: ##\n#####\n\n## Chat history: ##\n#####\n\nTry to respond any question using both context and chat history firstly.

While recent works have achieved impressive results in generating motion directly from textual action descriptions, they often support only a single modality of the control signal, which limits their application in the real digital human industry. This paper presents a Motion General-Purpose generaTor (MotionGPT) that can use multimodal control signals, e.g., text and single-frame poses, for generating consecutive human motions by treating multimodal signals as special input tokens in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer. Our MotionGPT demonstrates a unified human motion generation model with multimodal control signals by tuning a mere 0.4% of LLM parameters. To the best of our knowledge, MotionGPT is the first method to generate human motion by multimodal control signals, which we hope can shed light on this new direction.

The chance of heavy rains is lower compared to the earlier months. The sea may be a bit choppy though, so swimming and beach activities may be limited on some days.\n\n• The big crowds of the peak summer season have dwindled, so popular attractions like Kawasan Falls, Sardine Run, and Whale Shark watching in Oslob will be less busy. You can enjoy them more leisurely.\n\n• Sinulog Festival, Cebu's biggest cultural and religious festival happens in mid-January, so you'll miss the huge crowds that descend on Cebu during that time.\n\n• Hotel rates are more affordable compared to the high season. It's a good chance to get good deals on accommodation.\n\n• Whale shark watching in Oslob will still be open, so you can have the opportunity to swim with the gentle giants. December also falls within the whale shark season in Cebu.\n\n• There are more direct flights to Cebu available from major hubs like Manila, Seoul, Singapore, etc. So it's still easily accessible.\n\n• The holiday atmosphere will start to get festive, as Christmas approaches. Cebuanos take Christmas celebrations seriously, so you'll find colorful decorations, lights and events all over the city.\n\nSo overall, late November and early December can be an ideal time to experience Cebu when the crowds are smaller, rates are cheaper but the weather is still pleasant, and the festive mood is building up.

The weather is pleasant, with little rain and lots of sunshine. Sea conditions are calm, perfect for swimming and other beach activities. However, it is also the peak tourist season, so attractions and hotels are very crowded and rates are most expensive.\n\n• Shoulder Months (October to November, April to May): Just before and after the dry season. The weather is still mostly dry with some rain at times. Crowds have dwindled from the peak season but prices are still moderate. A good compromise if you want to avoid big crowds but still have mostly good weather.\n\n• Wet Season (June to September): Cebu experiences its heaviest rains from June to September. Expect frequent afternoon downpours and thunderstorms, as well as occasional flooding in some areas. The sea can also be rough at times. However, crowds are smallest and hotel rates are cheapest. If you don't mind the rain and want the best deals, the wet season is a good time to visit. Just be prepared for some activities to be limited on rainy days.\n\n• Sinulog Festival (mid-January): Cebu's biggest festival attracts large crowds for its colorful street parades, cultural performances and religious events. Hotel rates also spike during the festival. But if you want to experience Cebu's most festive cultural event, then mid-January is the time to go.\n\n• Whale Shark Season (March to May): The whale shark watching activity in Oslob peaks from March to May. This is the best time to have a high chance of swimming with and spotting the whale sharks.\n\nSo in summary, I would say the best times to visit Cebu are:\n\n• Dry Season (January to April): For the best weather and chance to enjoy the beaches. Just be ready for big crowds.\n\n• Shoulder Months (April-May, October-November): For smaller crowds and good weather at lower prices.\n\n• Whale Shark Season (March to May): To have the best chance of seeing and swimming with the whale sharks.\n\nDoes this help summarize the best times to visit Cebu?

Some things to know:\n\n• There are many bars, clubs, and music venues that are open late into the night, especially on weekends. Popular nightlife areas include Mango Square, IT Park, and various KTV bars. The party usually starts around 10 pm and goes on until the early morning hours.\n\n• Karaoke or KTV bars, where you can rent private rooms for singing with friends, are popular in Cebu. They often have bars and dance floors as well.\n\n• Cebuanos love live music. Many bars and clubs feature live rock, reggae or acoustic bands, especially on weekends.\n\n• There is a good bar scene with many places offering drink promos, ladies nights, and happy hour deals. Craft beer and cocktails are popular among younger Cebuanos.\n\n• While prostitution is illegal in the Philippines, there are certain bars and clubs in Cebu frequented by foreigners looking to hook up with local girls. However, casual dating and hookup culture are still relatively low key in Cebu compared to Western countries. Most Cebuanos tend to be conservative in dating and relationships.\n\n• Online dating apps like Tinder, Bumble and Filipino Cupid are popular for meeting and dating potential partners. But meeting in person usually comes before becoming intimate.\n\n• Cebuanos are typically friendly, hospitable and find interest in foreigners and travelers. It is not too difficult to find a date or hook up if you visit bars and clubs frequented by Cebuanos looking to meet new people. But do exercise caution as there are scams that target foreign men.\n\n• Be respectful of local sensibilities. Public displays of affection are frowned upon. And casual sex is still a taboo for most Cebuanos.\n\nSo in summary, Cebu does have an active nightlife where you can meet potential dates or hook ups, especially if you frequent the popular bars, clubs and music venues. However, do note that Cebuanos tend to be more conservative in their dating habits and relationships. And be cautious of any scams targeting foreign visitors. If you observe local customs and are respectful, you can certainly have an enjoyable nightlife experience in Cebu.", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"question_id": "d24d651ee85d4f90b63637149d4f1958", "arena_winner": "model_a", "selected_model": "claude-v1", "judge": "arena_user_11098", "language": "en", "turns_reported": 3, "conversation_length": 6, "few_shot_user_examples": [{"conversation_id": "37e084612b73473eac085cbc11d4b5d7::gpt-4", "utterance": "whats the weather in sf like this weekend?", "similarity": "0.2518"}, {"conversation_id": "23fc192189454a2ba83e30e59217058f::vicuna-7b", "utterance": "How's life going?", "similarity": "0.2762"}, {"conversation_id": "db3c022881494b65abdcfe6599227f71::koala-13b", "utterance": "Hello there!

To solve this problem, they created rules to limit the power of the magician while still retaining the benefits of the system.\n\nThe rules of the system are as follows:\n1. Each magic act must have a unique name.\n2. The magician can only do one magic act throughout their lifetime.\n3. The magician can only have one apprentice.\n\nThese three rules limit the power of the system while still allowing it to benefit the common people. Without these rules, the common people would become rich and powerful, which would be considered unjust by the magician community.\n\nDespite these restrictions, there are still some impressive feats of magic performed in this world. One such magician, named Shou Zi, was able to give the appearance of a blossoming cherry tree at night while everyone around him was asleep.

While recent works have achieved impressive results in generating motion directly from textual action descriptions, they often support only a single modality of the control signal, which limits their application in the real digital human industry. This paper presents a Motion General-Purpose generaTor (MotionGPT) that can use multimodal control signals, e.g., text and single-frame poses, for generating consecutive human motions by treating multimodal signals as special input tokens in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer. Our MotionGPT demonstrates a unified human motion generation model with multimodal control signals by tuning a mere 0.4% of LLM parameters. To the best of our knowledge, MotionGPT is the first method to generate human motion by multimodal control signals, which we hope can shed light on this new direction. Codes shall be released upon acceptance.", "similarity": "0.2474"}]}}

Build a solid aerobic base: Focus on long, steady rides at a moderate intensity to improve your aerobic fitness. Aim for 2-3 rides per week, each lasting between 1.5 to 3 hours, at a pace where you can still hold a conversation.\n\n2. Include interval training: Incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT) into your routine once or twice a week. These sessions should include short, intense efforts followed by periods of recovery. For example, try 4-6 intervals of 5 minutes at 90-95% of your FTP, with 5-minute recovery periods in between.\n\n3. Perform threshold workouts: Train at or near your FTP for extended periods to push your limits. A common threshold workout is 2-3 intervals of 10-20 minutes at 95-105% of your FTP, with 5-10 minutes of recovery between each effort.\n\n4. Improve your cycling technique: Focus on improving your pedaling efficiency, bike handling, and climbing skills. A smoother, more efficient technique will help you sustain a higher power output for longer periods.\n\n5. Train consistently: Stick to a structured training plan with a mix of aerobic, threshold, and interval workouts. Consistency is key to seeing improvements in your FTP.\n\n6. Monitor your progress: Regularly test your FTP to track your progress and adjust your training zones accordingly. You can do this by performing a 20-minute FTP test or using a power meter during your regular rides.\n\n7. Rest and recover: Give your body the time it needs to recover and adapt to the training stress. Schedule rest days and easier rides into your training plan, and pay attention to proper nutrition and sleep.\n\n8. Consider working with a coach or using a training platform: A cycling coach or a training platform like TrainerRoad or Zwift can provide personalized guidance and structure to help you reach your FTP goals.", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"question_id": "ef5269cde2524dc18358b1f6495a4b4e", "arena_winner": "model_b", "selected_model": "gpt-4", "judge": "arena_user_10268", "language": "en", "turns_reported": 1, "conversation_length": 2, "few_shot_user_examples": [{"conversation_id": "40a1301f932c4a4ebae03c00e9b44f9c::vicuna-13b", "utterance": "What other activities would complement running?

Condition - The condition of the grill will have the biggest impact on resale value. If it's been well-maintained and still in good working order, you can expect to get 50-70% of the original price. If it needs significant repairs or restoration, you'll be at the lower end of that range. Make sure you clean the grill thoroughly before selling and consider replacing worn out parts like burners, grates, igniters, etc.\n\n2. Model - The specific model of Weber grill also matters. Higher-end models from the Genesis and Summit lines will hold their value better than more basic models from the Spirit line. Limited edition or discontinued models can sometimes sell at a premium.\n\n3. Features - Grills with more features like side burners, infrared burners, rotisseries, etc. will typically have a higher resale value. Stainless steel grills also tend to hold value better than painted grills.\n\n4. Accessories - Including accessories you have for the grill - cover, utensil set, smoker box, griddle, etc. - can also help boost the resale price. Mention what's included in your listing.\n\n5. Recent retail price - The more recently you purchased your Weber grill and the closer it is to the current retail price of that model, the more you can expect to get for it. Grills that are 3-4 years old will sell for a significantly higher percentage of the original price than those that are 8-10 years old.\n\nGiven these factors, if your 5-year old Weber gas grill is a mid-range to high-end model, in good working condition, and you have some accessories to include, you can likely expect to sell it for 50-60% of the original retail price. But a lot will depend on the specific condition and details of your grill. Checking current listings for comparable used models on sites like Craigslist, eBay and Facebook Marketplace can also help determine a good asking price.", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"question_id": "4ad4d24792b64636adb45c0dfce0b837", "arena_winner": "model_b", "selected_model": "claude-v1", "judge": "arena_user_15482", "language": "en", "turns_reported": 1, "conversation_length": 2, "few_shot_user_examples": [{"conversation_id": "eb6bd4a18313427ebdb81e2c32aa901d::llama-13b", "utterance": "What is the best way to cook chicken?", "similarity": "0.1757"}, {"conversation_id": "fed0b0c012f84837a80baa2ae4d33a1d::koala-13b", "utterance": "I'm holding a 50m cord, I added to it a second cord of 5m to it, then, I added an extra cord of 20m to the second one.

In other words, it explores the existence of paths between nodes of the graph that don't traverse through particular colored edges. This concept is often used to study the robustness and resilience of networks under various constraints or conditions.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation:\n\n1. Graph: A graph is a mathematical structure that represents the relationship between pairs of objects. It consists of vertices (also known as nodes) and edges (also known as links). The vertices represent the objects, and the edges represent the relationships between them.\n\n2. Colored edges: In a graph, edges can be assigned different colors to indicate different types of connections or properties. For example, in a social network, blue edges might represent friendships, and red edges might represent professional relationships.\n\n3. Color-avoiding path: A color-avoiding path is a sequence of vertices and edges in a graph, such that no edge of a specific color is included in the path. For instance, if you want to find a path between two nodes that avoids red edges, you would only consider paths that traverse through edges of other colors.\n\n4. Color-avoiding connectivity: This property refers to the ability of a graph to maintain its connectivity, even when specific colored edges are avoided. In other words, it measures whether or not there exist color-avoiding paths between pairs of nodes in the graph. High color-avoiding connectivity indicates that the graph remains well-connected despite the restrictions imposed by avoiding certain colored edges.\n\nColor-avoiding connectivity can be used to study the behavior of networks under various scenarios, such as the removal of specific types of connections or the presence of constraints. This property is particularly useful in understanding the resilience and robustness of networks, as it highlights how the network's structure can adapt to changes and maintain its connectivity.", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"question_id": "76d2d95467cc4ff5a5badcb45c3288d0", "arena_winner": "model_b", "selected_model": "gpt-4", "judge": "arena_user_10375", "language": "en", "turns_reported": 1, "conversation_length": 2, "few_shot_user_examples": [{"conversation_id": "3a58d72a02224cda8d6dac9f5a7c236d::mpt-7b-chat", "utterance": "Can you provide examples?", "similarity": "0.2120"}, {"conversation_id": "2a32f5113fee43e3921767e84ecdbd25::RWKV-4-Raven-14B", "utterance": "I've heard rumours of flying rainbow-coloured alpacas... can you tell me more about them?", "similarity": "0.1840"}, {"conversation_id": "264ffd21973b42279edc9cc083c320c5::RWKV-4-Raven-14B", "utterance": "Be concise.

While recent works have achieved impressive results in generating motion directly from textual action descriptions, they often support only a single modality of the control signal, which limits their application in the real digital human industry. This paper presents a Motion General-Purpose generaTor (MotionGPT) that can use multimodal control signals, e.g., text and single-frame poses, for generating consecutive human motions by treating multimodal signals as special input tokens in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer. Our MotionGPT demonstrates a unified human motion generation model with multimodal control signals by tuning a mere 0.4% of LLM parameters. To the best of our knowledge, MotionGPT is the first method to generate human motion by multimodal control signals, which we hope can shed light on this new direction.

Midnight followed, her paws pounding the ground and her heart racing with excitement. She had never been on such an adventure before, and she felt alive and free.\n\nFinally, the bird led Midnight to the edge of the forest, where it perched on a tree branch and looked at her with a cheeky glint in its eye. Midnight sat down, panting and out of breath, and looked up at the bird. For a moment, they just sat there, looking at each other. And then, without warning, the bird took off, fluttering away into the depths of the forest.\n\nMidnight was left alone, her heart racing and her fur covered in sweat. She looked around her at the strange, unfamiliar world of the forest, and then she turned and started back towards home. As she padded through the trees, she felt a new sense of freedom and independence, and she knew that she would never be the same again.\n\nFrom that day on, Midnight ventured further and further into the forest, exploring new territories and making new friends.

While recent works have achieved impressive results in generating motion directly from textual action descriptions, they often support only a single modality of the control signal, which limits their application in the real digital human industry. This paper presents a Motion General-Purpose generaTor (MotionGPT) that can use multimodal control signals, e.g., text and single-frame poses, for generating consecutive human motions by treating multimodal signals as special input tokens in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer.

Could you please show me how to do this with the OpenText developer APIs?", "metadata": {}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure! Here's an example of how you can use the Text Analytics API to classify documents based on their sentiment:\n\nFirst, sign up for an OpenText account and create a project. Then, import the Text Analytics API into your Python script using the `opentext.api.TextAnalytics` class.\n\nNext, use the `TextAnalytics. labelled_documents()` method to load a labeled dataset of documents. The dataset should include documents labeled with a sentiment score, such as positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nOnce the dataset is loaded, you can use the `TextAnalytics. sentiment()` method to extract the sentiment of each document. The sentiment score is calculated based on the sentiment words in the document and the overall sentiment of the document.\n\nFinally, use the sentiment labels to classify each document into one of the three sentiment categories: negative, positive, or neutral. You can do this by creating a list of sentiment labels and using the `TextAnalytics. sentiment_class()` method to map each sentiment score to a label.\n\nHere's some sample code that demonstrates this process:\n\n```python\nimport opentext.api\nimport torch\n\n# Sign up for an OpenText account\nopentext = opentext.api.TextAnalytics()\n\n# Create a new project and dataset\nproject_id = 'your_project_id'\ndataset_id = 'your_dataset_id'\n\n# Load the dataset\nlabelled_documents = opentext.api.labelled_documents(\n    project_id=project_id,\n    dataset_id=dataset_id\n)\n\n# Extract the sentiment of each document\nsentiment_scores = labelled_documents[' sentiment_scores']\nlabels = labelled_documents['labels']\n\n# Classify each document into one of the three sentiment categories\n Document_classifications = []\n for sentiment_score, label in zip(sentiment_scores, labels):\n    Document_classifications.append((sentiment_score, label))\n\n# Output the sentiment classifications\nprint(Document_classifications)\n```\n\nThis code will output a list of tuples containing the sentiment score and label for each document in the dataset.

Data Quality: Make sure that the labeled dataset you are using is high-quality and includes documents with accurate sentiment labels. Check that the labels are consistent across all documents in the dataset and that there are no outliers that could affect the accuracy of your classification.\n\n2. Feature Engineering: Use feature engineering to create more informative features for your classification model. For example, you could use sentiment words and sentiment scores to create a feature vector that represents the sentiment of a document.\n\n3. Model Selection: Choose the right model for your task. Consider using a supervised learning model, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or a Naive Bayes classifier, for document classification. These models are able to handle large datasets and can effectively handle complex classification tasks.\n\n4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your classification model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

While recent works have achieved impressive results in generating motion directly from textual action descriptions, they often support only a single modality of the control signal, which limits their application in the real digital human industry. This paper presents a Motion General-Purpose generaTor (MotionGPT) that can use multimodal control signals, e.g., text and single-frame poses, for generating consecutive human motions by treating multimodal signals as special input tokens in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer. Our MotionGPT demonstrates a unified human motion generation model with multimodal control signals by tuning a mere 0.4% of LLM parameters. To the best of our knowledge, MotionGPT is the first method to generate human motion by multimodal control signals, which we hope can shed light on this new direction. Codes shall be released upon acceptance.", "similarity": "0.2209"}]}}

This means that the old images are made up of more individual pixels, which gives them a sharper, more detailed look.\n\nSecond, old film cameras were not as susceptible to noise as digital cameras. Noise is a type of graininess that can appear in digital images, especially in low-light conditions. The old film images are much less noisy, which gives them a smoother, more polished look.\n\nFinally, old film cameras had a wider dynamic range than digital cameras. Dynamic range is the range of brightness levels that a camera can capture. Old film cameras could capture a wider range of brightness levels than digital cameras, which means that the old images have more detail in both the highlights and shadows.\n\nAll of these factors contribute to the fact that old images of space rocket launches look better than newer, digital ones. If you're looking for the best possible image quality, then you should look for images that were taken with old film cameras.\n\nIn addition to the technical reasons mentioned above, there is also a subjective element to why old images of space rocket launches look better. Many people find the look of film to be more aesthetically pleasing than the look of digital images. This is likely due to the fact that film has a certain softness and graininess that digital images often lack. Additionally, the colors in film images can be more vibrant and saturated than the colors in digital images.\n\nUltimately, whether you prefer the look of old or new images of space rocket launches is a matter of personal preference. However, there is no denying that old images have a certain unique beauty that digital images cannot match.", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"question_id": "f0d7b72e1c00470395b8d7a41e8e9f79", "arena_winner": "model_b", "selected_model": "palm-2", "judge": "arena_user_13365", "language": "en", "turns_reported": 1, "conversation_length": 2, "few_shot_user_examples": [{"conversation_id": "795d7f0b246d47afb980afcdee16e75a::chatglm-6b", "utterance": "Which model is better?", "similarity": "0.2131"}, {"conversation_id": "0625d75387c24ae58cb3d7447d397e62::claude-v1", "utterance": "Is the moon bigger than the sun?", "similarity": "0.2127"}, {"conversation_id": "77c1cd098d5e44b191b3a50b40302187::wizardlm-13b", "utterance": "What does anisotropy look like", "similarity": "0.2023"}, {"conversation_id": "e53944a42d6b42e7a6785e3e3f93508d::koala-13b", "utterance": "What might the front page of Reddit look like in 2010?

Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer. Our MotionGPT demonstrates a unified human motion generation model with multimodal control signals by tuning a mere 0.4% of LLM parameters.

They are looking for a thoughtful and insightful discussion that explores how these concepts are interconnected and influence personal and social experiences. The tone is intellectual and reflective, aiming to provoke deeper understanding and contemplation.", "turns": [{"role": "user", "content": "Describe the connection between freedom and responsibility in human life", "metadata": {}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In human life, freedom and responsibility are deeply intertwined concepts that shape our personal and social experiences. Freedom refers to the ability to make choices, act according to one's desires, and express oneself without any constraints or restrictions. Responsibility, on the other hand, involves being accountable for one's actions, understanding the consequences of these actions, and accepting the moral and social obligations that come with freedom.\n\nThe connection between freedom and responsibility is crucial as it ensures a balance between individual autonomy and societal harmony. This connection can be explored through the following aspects:\n\n1. Moral and ethical obligations: With freedom comes the moral responsibility to make choices that are ethically sound and do not harm others. This means that one must be aware of the consequences of their actions and exercise their freedom responsibly to maintain a harmonious society.\n\n2. Rights and duties: In a democratic society, citizens are granted certain rights and freedoms, such as the right to free speech, the right to vote, and the right to privacy. However, along with these rights, citizens also have certain duties and responsibilities, such as obeying the law, paying taxes, and contributing to the general welfare of the society. This balance between rights and duties ensures that individuals can exercise their freedom without infringing on the rights and liberties of others.\n\n3. Personal growth and development: The connection between freedom and responsibility allows individuals to grow and develop personally, as well as contribute to the development of society. By exercising their freedom responsibly, individuals can learn from their experiences, make informed decisions, and develop a sense of self-awareness and empathy for others.\n\n4. Social contract: The connection between freedom and responsibility is also evident in the concept of the social contract. This notion implies that individuals agree to give up some of their freedoms in exchange for the protection and order provided by society. In this context, individuals have a responsibility to adhere to the rules and norms of society while still enjoying the freedoms granted to them.\n\n5. Accountability and consequences: When individuals exercise their freedom irresponsibly, they must face the consequences of their actions. This accountability serves as a reminder of the importance of responsible decision-making and encourages individuals to consider the potential outcomes of their choices.\n\nIn conclusion, the connection between freedom and responsibility in human life is essential for maintaining a balance between individual autonomy and the well-being of society. It requires individuals to be aware of the consequences of their actions, make ethical choices, and accept the moral and social obligations that come with freedom. By understanding and embracing the connection between freedom and responsibility, individuals can contribute to a more compassionate, just, and harmonious society.", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"question_id": "cb6575b481d94ddcb9c69c3e56d373fc", "arena_winner": "model_a", "selected_model": "gpt-4", "judge": "arena_user_6558", "language": "en", "turns_reported": 1, "conversation_length": 2, "few_shot_user_examples": [{"conversation_id": "ee08b2a9e7bb4c5fb8343f6895f7b569::koala-13b", "utterance": "he who wield the power need to be constraint", "similarity": "0.2803"}, {"conversation_id": "c2b9494b43b245848a80379d7b30db00::claude-instant-v1", "utterance": "what is the meaning of life/", "similarity": "0.2702"}, {"conversation_id": "f6468041874d440789d5dd28ca4b9393::gpt-3.5-turbo", "utterance": "\"There are limits to what any one person can comprehend - No single person can possibly have complete knowledge and wisdom about the complexity of all issues and systems on Earth.\" Analyze this quote.

Here are some suggestions to help ease into it:\n\n• Start small and build up your confidence. You don't have to jump into crowded or unfamiliar places right away. You can start by just stepping outside your door, walking around your yard. Then maybe walk around the block. Build up the distance and time outside slowly.\n\n• Choose less crowded times and places. If crowds make you nervous, go out during off-peak hours and stick to less populated areas at first. Parks, hiking trails, and quiet coffee shops can be good options.\n\n• Let someone know your plans. Tell a friend or family member where you're going and when you plan to be back. That can help you feel more at ease.\n\n• Start with an activity you enjoy. Go outside for a purpose, like exercising, gardening, or reading a book. Having an activity can help distract you from any anxiety and make the time pass more quickly.\n\n• Observe others and see that the world is generally safe. Go to a park and sit, watching people go about their day. This can help desensitize your worries and realize that most interactions and activities are normal and uneventful.\n\n• Face your fears in a gradual way. The more you go outside and have positive experiences, the less frightening it will feel. Exposure therapy works, even if it's hard. But start with baby steps.\n\n• Get professional help if needed. If your fear of going outside is severe enough to limit your life, consider seeing a therapist. They can help give you tools and strategies for overcoming your anxiety in a progressive way.\n\nThe most important thing is not to avoid going outside altogether.

For example, Trampolining returns the callee to the caller stack frame, which prevents the stack size from growing infinitely.", "metadata": {}}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are a few techniques that can be used to get around stack depth limits in programming languages. One technique is called tail call optimization. Tail call optimization is a compiler optimization that can be applied to recursive functions. When a function calls itself recursively, the compiler can replace the recursive call with a jump to the beginning of the function. This eliminates the need to allocate a new stack frame for each recursive call, which can prevent the stack from overflowing.\n\nAnother technique that can be used to get around stack depth limits is called trampoline. Trampoline is a technique that can be used to implement tail call optimization in languages that do not support it natively. When a function calls itself recursively, the trampoline code is executed instead of the function itself. The trampoline code then calls the function, and then returns to the caller. This effectively implements tail call optimization, even though the language does not support it natively.\n\nFinally, it is also possible to use a technique called continuation passing style (CPS) to get around stack depth limits. CPS is a way of representing functions as values. When a function is called in CPS, the caller passes the function's continuation as an argument. The continuation is a function that will be executed when the called function returns. This allows functions to be called without allocating a new stack frame for each call.\n\nAll of these techniques can be used to get around stack depth limits in programming languages. The best technique to use will depend on the specific language and the specific function that is being called.", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"question_id": "f5e47c352a074d98987ba3f62fe77660", "arena_winner": "model_b", "selected_model": "palm-2", "judge": "arena_user_6469", "language": "en", "turns_reported": 1, "conversation_length": 2, "few_shot_user_examples": [{"conversation_id": "c4ca919b2c6c4cd8a394bb058930742d::dolly-v2-12b", "utterance": "Can you list some functional languages?", "similarity": "0.3331"}, {"conversation_id": "d4eeb8a89ef745c8929ea89ee1b89f34::palm-2", "utterance": "rr, valgrind, gdb, perf, qemu, strace.

While recent works have achieved impressive results in generating motion directly from textual action descriptions, they often support only a single modality of the control signal, which limits their application in the real digital human industry. This paper presents a Motion General-Purpose generaTor (MotionGPT) that can use multimodal control signals, e.g., text and single-frame poses, for generating consecutive human motions by treating multimodal signals as special input tokens in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we first quantize multimodal control signals into discrete codes and then formulate them in a unified prompt instruction to ask the LLMs to generate the motion answer. Our MotionGPT demonstrates a unified human motion generation model with multimodal control signals by tuning a mere 0.4% of LLM parameters. To the best of our knowledge, MotionGPT is the first method to generate human motion by multimodal control signals, which we hope can shed light on this new direction. Codes shall be released upon acceptance.", "similarity": "0.2728"}]}}

Some reasons to use Microsoft.Data.SqlClient over System.Data.SqlClient are:\n\n- It's built to be cross-platform, so it works on .NET Core which runs on Linux, macOS and Windows. System.Data.SqlClient only works on Windows.\n- It has better performance than System.Data.SqlClient.\n- It supports newer SQL Server features that System.Data.SqlClient does not.\n\nExample code using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient:\n```csharp\nusing Microsoft.Data.SqlClient;\n\nstring connectionString = \"Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=databaseName;Integrated Security=True\";\n\nusing (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    connection.Open();\n    \n    string query = \"SELECT * FROM TableName\";\n    \n    using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(query, connection))\n    {\n        using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())\n        {\n            while (reader.Read())\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(reader[\"ColumnName\"]);    \n            }    \n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe code is very similar to the previous example, but uses Microsoft.Data.SqlClient instead of System.Data.SqlClient.\n\nThe main differences are:\n\n- Use Microsoft.Data.SqlClient namespace\n- Use SqlConnection, SqlCommand and SqlDataReader from Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\n\nSo in summary, Microsoft recommends Microsoft.Data.SqlClient over System.Data.SqlClient for .NET Core and .NET Standard applications due to its cross-platform support, performance and newer SQL Server feature support.\n\nHope this helps explain the difference and provides a useful code example!
